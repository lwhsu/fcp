# FCP 20190401-ci_policy: CI policy

This document aims to present a set of policies to ensure that the FreeBSD base system
consistently builds and functions correctly.

## Problem Statement

FreeBSD has a continuous integration system (currently managed with Jenkins) at
https://ci.freebsd.org to validate that the base system compiles for
most supported architectures and configurations.  The same tool also runs
automated tests for the base system.

Sometimes developers commit changes which break compilation on one or more
platforms or cause test failures.  Finally, a panic or a similar problem during
a test run may prevent us from obtaining any test results at all.

One of the main functions of the CI system is letting committers know if there
is a build failure or test regression as early as possible.  FreeBSD's CI
system is configured to send failure or instability notifications to the committer
and the dev-ci@freebsd.org mailing list.  Ideally the original committer responds to
these notifications by committing a fix or revert themselves.  If these
reports are not addressed in a timely manner a number of negative effects
compound:

 - Other issues may be hidden by this failure
 - Development on affected platforms may be blocked
 - Downstream users may struggle to find a usable version

While developers are usually very responsive to reports of build failures, they
may not always know how to resolve a specific issue promptly, or may not have the time to immediately
address it.

Other developers do not always feel empowered to revert such commits.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a policy explicitly empowering developers to revert commits which
cause compilation problems, test failures, or panics during tests.

We describe the recommended steps to take, notifications to send,
and recommended timeout periods.

### Notification

Everyone (committers and non-committers alike) is
encouraged to investigate failures in non-experimental jobs [1].
The investigator should prepare a report identifying the commit which triggered
the failure as well as details about the failure (for example, compile errors or
output from failing tests).  The investigator should
send this report to all of the following:

 - The author of the triggering commit
 - Other people, if any, who've touched the relevant code after the triggering
   commit
 - The dev-ci@freebsd.org list (to avoid duplicate notifications)

### Waiting period

Once the notification has been sent, the author of the problematic commit should
be given a reasonable amount of time to respond.
This time will vary depending on the severity of the problem and how many
platforms it affects:

 - If a commit broke compilation on all platforms, it can be reverted after
   15 minutes
 - If a commit broke compilation on a tier 1 platform, it can be reverted after
   4 hours
 - If a commit broke compilation on tier 2 or 3 platforms, it can be reverted
   after 12 hours
 - If a commit triggers a panic during the automated test run (and thus blocks
   all tests), it can be reverted after 24 hours
 - If a commit causes a test regression (of one of the automated tests), it can
   be reverted after 48 hours

Note that these are minimal guidelines. If the author of the problem has
responded with a request for more time this will be respected within reason.

### Revert

If a commit must be reverted, the commit message should
explicitly mention the revision it is reverting and explain why.

For example:

    Revert rNNNNNN: <original commit headline>

    This does not build in i386:
      <Compiler error message>

[1] Non-experimental job means a job which sends build status notifications to
    the committer or the dev-ci@freebsd.org list.
